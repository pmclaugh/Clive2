Bidirectional Path Tracing orchestrated with Python and run with Metal. 
This is a work in progress and may be unstable, incorrect, etc. 
Performance is... fine? Other than a simple BVH implementation, optimization has not been a priority yet. 

Working:
- Bidirectional Path Tracing in Metal
- Importance sampling, balance heuristic
- Loading OBJ files
- BVH acceleration structure
- Diffuse and specular materials, including transmission
- GGX BRDF
